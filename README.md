# ics2csv
This is an batch-exporter for online ics calendars into csv files without the need of extra packages libraries etc. - This is plain windows batch processing!
# Background / Intention
It was intentionally made for users with windows machines - e.g. for employees from associations or organizations to further progress their online calendars e.g. in excel, word etc.
It would be very nice if someone is motivated to port this code to bash, node.js or whatever else - please get in touch with me!
